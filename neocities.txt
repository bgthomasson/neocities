A topical schematic to organize my mind. 

+ Index 
+ UPDATE links! more! more! 
+ Code needs more professional writing lol ALSO! font license info. 

+ pronk! 1999 inspired but use newer code. 
need color palette and font! bold colors. like this https://twovolt.neocities.org/ 
I forgot https://mw.rat.bz/colors/ is retro CRT but there are some cromulent pallettes here. 
maybe a dark theme? green or amber text? a green that isn't too yellow neon? 

amber: 
Foreground Dark..: #AA4400 
Foreground Normal: #CC9900 
Foreground Light.: #FFCC00 
Background: #141704 

Jade Green  
Foreground: #29FF48 
Background: #1E1F0F 

for header font "Alpha Echo" is close enough and totally free!!! 
# news, music, members, photos, [merch, tour dates] 
# bandcamp, facebutt, instaspam, yutoube 

I'm thinking just having some imaginary local live show announcements and links to buy music and some lyrics down below. 
lots of teh sites I see are fairly basic. 
IF it's just two items then do a 2 col layout with flex and size change? 
! images: use clip-path to do fancy things!!! https://css-tricks.com/tag/clip-path/ 
> need a logo, maybe pixel mini and SVG big? 
> less flat, more shadows? 


----------------------
+ newspaper idea: do history of PCC and maybe have JS style switch for eras like Victorian 1899, hippie 1969, frutiger 2009. 
? is it possible for the css switching to also hide/show different elements? 


>>
family tree and recipe stuff needs a blog, better to use blogspot? 
it seems like every time I try to do something local some SE Linux bullshit or build error or some damn thing happens. 




-------------------------------------------
Lighthouse scores! 
- slow speed because still importing two Google fonts don't really need to, so cut that. 
- forgot to have  lang="en-US" in html element on main page somehow! 
  but all other access values are good! color contrast, alt in img, etc. 
- SEO is all good except no meta tag? hmm. 
  <meta name="description" content="Put your description here.">
  also each page title needs to be distinct somehow. 
- browser errors were logged to console. oh, it's a font error. idk how to fix that. 

# OK so got lang in html, a vague but workable meta tag, and mostly just removed the font import. 
speed went from 3 or 4 seconds to 1 second for first paint, 2.5 for largest 
font download is only 40kb now. total is 283kb. 
lowest overall score is 95%, highest is 99%. 
performance 95% looks like it wants smaller images or WebP fuck that all my homies hate WebP. 
access 100% 
best practices 96% still console errors lol 
SEO 100% 

----
Vague ideas- 
? anime manga movies etc:: how can I make fave lists FUN? dynamic. a fancier chronology? a web type thing? faux image map? 


Linux stuff? 
Dragalia lost?? 

? Neon frutiger crazy deco page 

? central settings panel for colors etc.; font settings as well? 
? play an audio file when click button! web audio api?? 




---------------
Games!? 
2048- needs more work, all the js is a mess. 
strip poker- would be amusing but lots of code. have transparent PNG to reveal naked Yata. 


--------------------------
more centering bullshit! for some reason on the OTHER project a simple text-align: center got the text and img to center in the page. 
BUT in this one it only centered in it's own box!?!? 
OHH is it becuase i put a max-width on the <p> element!? let's find out! 
it appears so. though the image box is to the left BUT it's not finding an image. I am having issues with permissions on my own server!!!
quick upload to imgur and see image now but it's still to the left! hmm. IDK! everything else is ok. 
if this keeps up I'll have to go flexbox but first I need good refs. 
I have a 1600px wide img now and that's kind of too big? 

A HAH I did the obvious and used the web panel thing to turn things off- it's the display:block I have on all images! 
honestly IDK why I had that other than I was copying a reset CSS but it had not caused an issue before. 
probably because I've been using flex and grid to cetner things.


https://codepen.io/wallas/pen/nRRKja this is cool skeumorphic if I can work out how. 


It would be cool to have a rotated banner 
.vertibird {
    writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}


actual checkerboard: 

.checkers {
    background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(var(--bg1) 0% 25%, var(--bg2) 0% 50%);
    background-size: var(--size) var(--size);
}

tilting it means adding a "from 45deg" at the start, we can make this a var like 
--dangle: 0deg; 
and then have the #box:checked routine, already tested. 
note that playing around, anything other than "standard" angle may result in humorous results.

I was trying to use Yata colors cuz I did ages ago and it was mellow earthtones but omg. 

this one is very 70s feeling, ugly and bold, lol. 
:root:has(#earth1976:checked) {
    color-scheme: light;
    --ink: rgb(20, 20, 20); 
    --paper: rgb(243, 243, 243); 
    --bg1: rgb(70, 30, 3);
    --bg2: rgb(235, 203, 114);
    --border1: rgb(250, 190, 44);
    --border2: rgb(59, 161, 68);
}

aiming for calmer colors but still not satisfied. 
:root:has(#earth:checked) {
    color-scheme: light;
    --ink: rgb(20, 20, 20); 
    --paper: rgb(243, 243, 243); 
    --bg1: rgb(168, 128, 56);
    --bg2: rgb(235, 203, 114);
    --border1: rgb(250, 190, 44);
    --border2: rgb(59, 161, 68);
}

went darker but it's even uglier somehow. 
:root:has(#earth:checked) {
    color-scheme: dark;
    --ink: rgb(245, 244, 244);
    --paper: rgb(27, 13, 1);
    --bg1: rgb(70, 30, 3);
    --bg2: rgb(85, 46, 14);
    --border1: rgb(121, 96, 33);
    --border2: rgb(59, 161, 68);
}

CMY + RGB = YRMBCG so yellow, red, magenta, blue, cyan, green 
LITE: gold, fire, lilac, sky, sage
DARK: mahogany, cherry, deep purple, navy, forest 


:root:has(#color [value="gold"]:checked) {
    --bg1: rgb(238, 215, 114);
}

:root:has(#color [value="fire"]:checked) {
    --bg1: rgb(209, 20, 6);
}

:root:has(#color [value="amethyst"]:checked) {
    --bg1: rgb(78, 39, 94);
}

:root:has(#color [value="minty"]:checked) {
    --bg1: rgb(192, 214, 194);
}


/* So if we're on a phone, the width of the main is 100% and the cool background is invisible, so we don't need this. (I think!) */
@media (width < 70ch) {
    .bg-picker {
        display: none;
    }
}

---------------------
this is the dropdown version

    <label>Dark/Lite:
        <select data-theme-picker name="themepicker" id="theme">
            <option value="dark">Dark mode</option>
            <option value="light">Light mode</option>
        </select>
    </label>

:root:has(#theme [value="light"]:checked) {
    color-scheme: light;
    --bg1: rgb(40, 51, 80);
    --ink: rgb(12, 12, 12);
    --paper: rgb(240, 240, 240);
    --muted: rgb(103, 118, 126);
    --focus: rgb(123, 196, 211);
}

:root:has(#theme [value="dark"]:checked) {
    color-scheme: dark;
    --bg1: rgb(19, 27, 48);
    --ink: rgb(244, 244, 244);
    --paper: rgb(16, 16, 18);
    --muted: rgb(35, 55, 66);
    --focus: rgb(93, 177, 194);
}

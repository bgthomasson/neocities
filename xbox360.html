                I got my 360 in 2009. 
                The good thing about waiting several years to get a new one, other than used games being more common and cheaper, 
                is it's a Jasper model that doesn't red ring of death. 
                In fact the only problem it has now is the disc drive gets sticky since I don't use it much anymore.

            <h2>Oblivion</h2>
            <p>
                The quests are better than Skyrim. Dark Brotherhood and Thieves guild alone. 
                Besides the potato face people it still looks decent, some tree graphics are still kinda wonky, but it's nice to just explore. 
                It certainly has more bugs than a Louisiana bayou, the oblivion gates are a pain, and it's hard to level and not regret it. 
                But that's why I then got it cheap on PC to mod the hell out of it. Also, making mods is fun, if clunky and arcane.

            <h2>Red Faction Guerilla</h2>
            <p>
                Simply smashing, since I mostly remember running around the Martian desert smashing things. 
                There's a vague story, but like Otogi before, that partis dim in my memory, though I did enjoy it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in the sequel you're just running down a tunnel killing alien bugs, no fun, no quests, totally sucks, I hated it.

            <h2>Dragon Age Origins</h2>
            <p>
                It is kind of clunky and 2 was smoother in those respects but more frustrating in others. 
                But I started out with the 90s style CRPGs where you had to work out all sorts of stats and loot.

            <h2>Batman Arkham Asylum</h2>
            <p>
                So it's basical Splinter Cell and Thief combined: ninja sneaking around in a spooky city. 
                Decent side quest collecting things. 
                I wasn't great at the fighting since I tend to be reckless in games.

            <h2>Mass Effect 1 2 3</h2>
            <p>
                Yes just put all of them together even though each one changed the gameplay. 
                OK so each one had good and bad aspects, I'd have to say 2 was best overall. 
                It got rid of some of the more tedious bits of stats and loot before getting so polished it was just a generic commodity. 
                You can really see the evolution from story driven CRPG to "shooter with some stats meant to appeal to everyone" style.

            <h2>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</h2>
            <p>
                Like Batman but cyberpunk. I guess they had a lot of grim city games this era.

            <h2>Skyrim</h2>
            <p>
                Does anyone not know about it? Is there anything left to say? 
                My favorite part was exploration, it became my "rainy cold day" game. 
                In fact the first time, since I knew TES games let you ignore the main quest, I simply headed off into the wilderness.

            <p>
                Oh look another game where you sneak around in a dystopian city. 
                I seem to have a type.

            <h2>Flatout UC - VERSUS! - Burnout Revenge!</h2>
            <p>
                I thought I'd put both car racing smashing mayhem games together. 
                Flatout has fun game things, but Burnout has better actual racing for me since they don't throw random crap in the way constantly. 
                Also the Revenge part is fun. So really I can't pick one over the other.

            <h2>Overlord</h2>
            <p>
                You're the big bad guy, sending swarms of minions to ruin the day for fat lazy hobbitses! 
                I always fought with the camera, though, it tends to end up in a corner all awkward. 
                Certainly an interesting idea, so even tho I still haven't finished it I'll put it here.

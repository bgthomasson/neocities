        <h2>Toggle colors and stuff!</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/zFFuV_vXNhY?si=29r0aHG_Zbq0V33D">Dark theme toggle</a> 
            I started with, and then 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/fyuao3G-2qg?si=3x4HHq_1UaB3eZCG">this other one</a> 
            was useful. 
            I used some of the "<a href="https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/">safe rules</a>" like desaturated colors instead of pure black/white. 
            I tested having light and dark modes apart from the main palettes but certain ones just worked better either way so I combined light/dark into each. 
            There was just too much contrast with some of them, had a glare. 
            Honestly to be practical there should be 4 at most, but I was aiming for ROYGBIV plus white and black. 
            Note that yellow can be hard to work with, a yellow that isn't fully saturated just looks dingy and dirty. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the patterns, the squares came from one on <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/">here</a> like a decade ago and evolved into that. 
            For the stars I just took <a href="https://css-pattern.com/stars/">this</a> since there's math. 
            And from there also <a href="https://css-pattern.com/cubes-illusion/">cubes</a> looked good. 
            The main page is based on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-that-use-only-one-gradient/">an example here</a> 
        </p>
        <p>
            I need the picker in the header? or a sidebar? or flyout menu!?!?

        <h2>Centering shenanigans</h2>
        <p>
            You can't beat old "margin zero auto" to center things 100% of the time, no worries about wrappers or boxes, just THIS THING will be in the center. 
            Other stuff may be broken on IE6 or whatever, but it's in the middle gosh darn it. And all you have to do is slap "center-margin" on the /main/. 
            If you want something newer, or don't want the margin to be zero, there's "margin-inline" which is in all major browsers since 2021. 
            Note that here I'm keeping in mind my /p/ tag has a max-width and there's a margin inside each /article/ to add in. 
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
.center-margin {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 70em;
}

.center-inline {
    width: min(70em, 100%);
    margin-inline: auto;
}
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Using flexbox or grid is possible, BUT! it applies to items inside, not the box itself, so like here I have the header at 100% width of the page just because. 
            Put "center-grid" on the /main/ and it just sits on the left side. Put it on /body/ and we shrink the /header/ as well. 
            Wrapping /main/ in a /div/ puts us on the path to div soup. 
            Of course, if you are using grid, then you could put the header as a sidebar when the page is over 800px or whatever. 
            I have several test pages like that, experimenting with sticky positioning etc. so I'm saving grid positioning for when I use it all over.

        <h2>Fonts!</h2>
        <p>
            Very important on a personal site. 
            For the main body text i decided sans serif would work best, and the Noto family is good, even if I don't expect to use odd characters. 
            For monospace I went with Fira Code to start, I've been using it in command line. 
            For serif, Source. 
            However, I like the other fonts in the Source family and choice #2 is to simply use Source family for all of them. 
            That would be harmonious but hardly quirky. 
            On top of that I want to self host, more private and practical. 
            Dig through <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/find_fonts?filter%5Blicense%5D%5B0%5D=web">here</a> to start. 
            In fact it's a good time to also make some css for list styling. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/1942-report">amusing for X Files</a></li>
            <li>Anonymous, maybe</li>
            <li>Atomic Age, nice retro</li>
            <li>Baloo, maybe too soft</li>
            <li>Calligraffiti, nice.</li>
            <li>Henry Morgan Hand is perfect for any pirate themed site.</li>
            <li>Hornswoggled has character but a little too kiddie</li>
            <li>Libre Baskerville and Caslon are both good dignified choices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It took some work to find ones that I can self host with license but <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/calligraffiti">Calligraffiti</a> works. 
            It's script that is legible and "grown up" enough. I like "rock salt" also but it's a little too messy.

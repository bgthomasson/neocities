            Action/genki girl. Kung fu. Cool cars, I thought race car driver would be a fun job, lol. 
            Bennu's monkey cousin, but her color scheme is just random fun colors with no basis in any real monkey species.

            Shocking twist, this is the only character I didn't design. 
            Wayyyy back in 2006 "Yunicoon" on FurAffinity had a thing to collab on designing based on a sketch, all I picked was some likes. 
            But later I ended up drawing her a few times, and those being simpler days, after a while she was like "you can have her" lol. 
            So I keep her around but don't really think of her as 100% "mine".

            I made her for a DND campaign run by my ex that died after two sessions, lol. 
            However I liked her enough to keep around as background character and pin up model. 
            So for stories she's a childhood friend that's an archaeologist. 
            And snow leopards like it cool so she tends to wear shorts and light clothing.

            Fantasy DND type stuff, both basic and steampunk type stuff, she's a mechanic in modern times. 
            I decided a monkey-dragon should have a kobold around, but not the typical minion. 
            She's useful and clever. Lives in the kobold tunnels but they've upgraded to modern times, like they have servers full of pirated anime.

            Singer. Friendly extrovert. I have a good grasp on her personality but not any hobbies, lol. 
            I wanted Bennu to have an actual back story so about 2012 I added a garage band with guys, but then decided some punk girls would be fun too. 
            Her name is from the Alabama language and means strawberry.

        <img loading="lazy" src="" alt="Gabby reference" width="800px" height="800px" />
        <p>
            Drummer. Into yoga and healthy junk like that. Very tall. Has a family farm. 
            I decided a French giant donkey would be amusing, her full name is like Gabrielle Sterreden or something. 
            I have a friend who likes donkeys so that's where I got the species idea, the rest is me being silly, since Gabby comes from The Ramones Yo Gabba Gabba thing. 
            Turns her mane into a mohawk and dyes it different colors.

            Bass player. Indonesia. Science stuff. For her I went ironic, the big scary lizard is a shy nerd. 
            Likes warm weather and wears a leather jacket most of the time.

            Guitar. Booze. Tattoos. Garden. For her I was inspired by that friend again, besides donkeys she had a wolverine character, 
            so having my own rowdy extrovert wolverine in a wild punk band seemed like a great idea. 
            Naturally she likes cold weather and snow.

            I suck at names. The singer in Bennu's garage band, I thought maybe he could be a music teacher as an adult.

            I'm not sure what name to use, I just suck at names sometimes. 
            He's a shy nerd that plays bass. Left their small town for a coding job in the big city, visits sometimes.

            I gave him a random name, IDK, he's the drummer, an American bison, rather gruff and hard headed. 
            That's all I got so far.

            Another experiment added to the mix, became one of the friend group hanging around. 
            Plays guitar and has a family farm they go party at.

        <p>
            A Louisiana black bear Cajun chef with a soft voice and friendly manner. 
            Back in 2011 I decided to make some characters based on local native species and she's one that's stuck around as a background character. 
            Her name is just the Caddo word for bear so maybe I should revise it sometime.
